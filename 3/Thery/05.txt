What is event handling in jQuery?

    --> Event handling in jQuery means writing code that tells the program what action to perform when a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a button, pressing a key, or changing input.

    Example:- 
        If a user clicks a button, jQuery can run some code.

            $("#btn").click(function() {
                alert("Button clicked!");
            });

    --> Event handling in jQuery is the process of detecting user actions like click, key press, or change in input and executing a function in response to those actions.
