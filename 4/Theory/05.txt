5. Compare jQuery AJAX with modern fetch() API.
    --> Both jQuery AJAX and the modern fetch() API are used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to a server, but they differ in syntax, flexibility, and usage.

    1. Introduction
        --> jQuery AJAX → Part of the jQuery library ($.ajax())
        --> fetch() API → Built-in modern JavaScript feature (no library required)

    2. Syntax Comparison
        --> jQuery AJAX
            $.ajax({
                url: "data.json",
                method: "GET",
                success: function(response) {
                    console.log(response);
                }
            });
