1. What is AJAX?
    --> AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
    -->It is a technique used in web development to send and receive data from a server without reloading the entire web page. This makes websites faster and more interactive.

    --> Simple Explanation :- With AJAX, only part of a webpage updates, instead of refreshing the whole page.

    Example :- 
        $.ajax({
            url: "data.txt",
            success: function(result) {
                $("#demo").html(result);
            }
        });

    Key Points

        AJAX works asynchronously (in the background).

        It improves user experience and speed.

        It uses JavaScript to communicate with the server.

        Data is often sent in JSON or XML format.
