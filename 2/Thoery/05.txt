Explain animation chaining in jQuery.

    --> Animation Chaining in jQuery
    --> Animation chaining in jQuery means running multiple effects or animations one after another on the same element using a single statement.
    --> jQuery makes this possible because most jQuery methods return the same jQuery object, allowing methods to be chained.

    Why animation chaining is used
        --> Cleaner and shorter code 
        --> Ensures animations run in sequence, not all at once
        --> Improves readability
        --> No need for callback hell

    How it works
        --> jQuery uses an internal animation queue
        --> Each effect waits until the previous one completes  
        --> Animations execute step by step
