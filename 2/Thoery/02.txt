Explain .hide() and .show() methods.
    1. hide() method
    --> The .hide() method hides selected elements by setting their CSS display property to none.

    Syntax :- 
        $(selector).hide();

    With speed and callback
        $(selector).hide(speed, callback);

    2. .show() method
    --> The .show() method displays hidden elements by restoring their original display value.

        With speed and callback
            $(selector).show(speed, callback);

    Key Points :-
        Both methods can accept:
            Speed: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds
            Callback function (runs after animation)
